                    <p>“I need to get at least 100 in the TOEFL test within three months and thus I think personalized training can give me more targeted training and save my time,” said Yue Ma who failed to achieve that score in her first test when she
                        studied on her own.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Indeed, I made it after taking the VIP course and it is worthwhile,” added she who paid 30,000 yuan for the test preparation program.
                    </p>
                    <p>The increases in discretionary income of Chinese families, which allow parents and students to be more willing and able to pay higher course fees for the more individualized attention, pushes the transformation of smaller class size,
                        or VIP courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the number of test preparation centers grows, many capital players are joining in this market. In 2013, CVC capital, a world leading private equity firm, backed Eic Education which is one of the most popular high-end English training
                        institutions in China. But CVC sold its stake in the company and terminate the plan to raise US$500 million on the Hong Kong bourse in 2016. The sale of the stake brought CVC a profit of 4.5 billion yuan according to the reporting
                        by Reuters.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the quality of training courses and the practices those test preparation institutions used are adding risks in the further development of this market.

                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-8">
                    <p>In most test preparation centers, the rate for a VIP class, which refers to the class of one teacher and one student, is about 500 yuan per hour. Many families will spend over 30,000 yuan for the whole preparation procedure, according
                        to information from a Shenzhen based test preparation center.
                    </p>
                    <p>The annual turnover of the VIP test preparation market amount up to <strong>7.86 billion yuan </strong> calculating based on the data from Chinese Ministry of Education that 523,700 Chinese students went abroad to study in 2015 and
                        half of the students going overseas choose to take VIP courses.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many of those English test preparation centers will provide self-learning rooms like libraries and hire tutors to help students with their English study. Generally, a student will spend a whole summer vocation in the center taking
                        classes and doing exercises. </p>
                    <p>“A whole day learning environment with tutor’s monitoring is the selling point that attracts most parents,” said Ziyuan Tang, an English teacher of GRE, TOEFL and SAT in a popular high-end test preparation center.

                    <p>The average spent for a month’s course during the summer vocation is at least 30,000 yuan or 1000 yuan per day. Like taking summer school courses, those students will come to the English school and take classes every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>Though Shenzhen is one of the four first-tier cities in China, unlike Beijing or Shanghai where locates many top universities nationwide, Shenzhen does not have much high-level educational institutions. On the other hand, with Information
                        Technology as the pillar industry, Shenzhen attracts hundreds of thousand highly educated young residents with substantial family wealth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Knowing the limitation of domestic high-level education and the highly competitive environment, those families tend to send their children to international schools and foreign language schools. This fact may explain why most courses
                        provided by those test preparations in Shenzhen are targeting high school or middle school students who plans to study overseas.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the reporting by Sina in 2013, one third of students enrolled in top four high schools in Shenzhen will choose to pursue their undergraduate studies overseas. “At least 2000 high school graduates will study overseas and
                        the number will grow at 10 percent annually”, said Suqiong Zhou, the general manager of Eic Education Shenzhen Branch in an interview with Sina.

                    <p> <strong>“Parents in Shenzhen are rich but foolish” </strong>, said Ziyuan. In Shenzhen, parents are willing to spend tens of or even hundreds of thousand yuan on their children’s test preparation but they have no idea about the teachers,
                        the teaching plans or teaching materials.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ziyuan said most of her colleagues in Shenzhen are English major graduates from bottom ranked first-tier universities which many people may not hear before. <strong>“Only 20 to 30 percent of them have overseas experience.”</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, the entry barrier of becoming an English teacher is quite low. “Those test preparation centers will<strong> NOT </strong>ask for language ability proof or any grade report of those overseas test. They only give me a very
                        easy English test and a 15 to 20 minutes’ trial lecture,” Ziyuan said. It is quite common in those test preparation centers that GRE teachers have never taken GRE and SAT teachers have no test experience of SAT. “Though I teach
                        the reading and math section of SAT, I have never taken the SAT test,” she added.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, there is no assessment for teachers’ performance and seldom will the test preparation center link teachers'' income with their students’ scores. </p>
                    <p>“Teaching is all based on conscience and those parents will not care about the teaching style or distribution of the class time,” said Ziyuan. “At least, I will not let my students do exercises in my class.”

                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>When parents are more willing to pay premium for exclusive attention and personalized course schedule for their children, the traditional large classes model, popular among big chains, is facing severe challenges that will adversely
                        affect those big educational chains. They also face transformation pressure from the market and the competitors.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the annual report of the New Oriental or XDF <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/edu?ltr=1">(NYSE: EDU)</a>, the largest educational institute that focuses on language education in China, it has decreased the class size of
                        short-term language training and test preparation courses from an average of 30 students in 2009 to 8 students per class in 2016. The company offers over ten different types of classes for TOEFL tests with the price ranging from
                        3,000 to 39,800 per program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course, the course price for small sized classes will be lifted up. “Although our smaller-sized classes are highly profitable, they are marginally less profitable on average than our large classes,” says the company.

                        In addition, New Oriental also faces severe challenges arising from rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive private education sector in China. Many educational institutions also provide similar courses. While the New Oriental started from
                        TOEFL test preparation and specialized on that, the Global IELTS focuses more on IELTS. The Global IELTS is operated by the Global Education & Technology Co.,Ltd., which delisted from NASDAQ and was acquired by Pearson Group in
                        2011, a year after the listing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But still, the huge commercial scale of those big chains guarantees the quality of educational resources, both teachers and learning materials, and the influence to the whole industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the annual report, as of May 31, 2016, the New Oriental delivered their educational programs, services and products to students through 66 schools, 748 learning centers and 22 bookstores in 55 cities of China. The Global IELTS has about 300
                        schools across 104 cities in China, a much larger coverage than the New Orientals. But the branches of the Global IELTS are less centralized in first- and second- tier cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beijing, where the headquarter of the New Oriental locates, has the most students enrollments in overseas test preparation courses, hitting about 35.6 percent of the total number, far more than the second city, Shanghai, which recorded 10.2 percent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meizhi Wang from Harbin went to Beijing for a whole summer to study SAT and TOEFL. The program she enrolled in was like a summer camp which included accommodation and meals. As a response of the reason why she chose New Oriental, she said “For most Chinese
                        people, New Oriental is the first name to think of when talking about English training. Also, they have the most updated material and the best teachers in China.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the inception in 1993, the New Oriental has had approximately 25.3 million cumulative students enrollments. In the year ending May 31, 2016, about 652,000 students enrolling in the test preparation courses, including domestic tests.

                        Besides competitors that provide similar services, the trend of online studying brought international educational institutions into the competing Chinese market. <a href="https://magoosh.com/">Magoosh</a>, a United States based
                        online test preparation company, provides materials for the GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, SAT, ACT, LSAT and etc. They have online tutors answering questions 24 hours since they are providing services to students in over 185 countries. The
                        cost of the online services by Magoosh is much lower than the VIP classes and most of the big-sized class in those big chains. There are also several plans with different effective durations available for users to choose from.
                        The rate for TOEFL course is only US$39.2 for a month and the plan for six months is only US$71.2.

                        In 2007, New Orientals and Educational Testing Service or ETS, which administers the TOEFL and GRE test, reached an agreement on the authorization of the TOEFL Practice Online, or the TPO in China. New Orientals therefore has an exclusive right to sell
                        TPO and provide it as a part of its test preparation courses.

                <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                    <p>The school has also acquired the authorization of many other test preparation materials provided by international education content providers, such as British Council, which hosts the IELTS test, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Pearson
                        Education, Oxford University Press, and etc.

                    </p>
                    <p>The company translated and localized those materials and sell those books with both parties’ logo at a much cheaper price which is in line with the average book price in Chinese market compared with the original version sold overseas.
                        Take the Official Guide of TOEFL test as an example: The Chinese version can be get by 70 yuan (around US$10) while the original version by ETS is US$25.

                        <p>Apart from those test preparation materials that will help test takers improve their language abilities, there is another material called “Jijing” that is popular among Chinese test takers to boost the test scores even higher.
                            Though, it is an illegal and unethical material that will threaten the fairness of the test, it is still widely used by test preparation courses.

                        </p>
                        <p>Many Chinese students will buy “Jijing” or “computer test bible”--the literal translation of the Jijing-- from some so called “famous teachers or analysts” who “anticipates” the pattern and the range of the real test questions.
                            It is like an exercise book with questions that have been used in the North America exams.

                        </p>
                        <p>The value of the Jijing lies in the reuse of test questions by test organizers with a relatively fixed time pattern, usually in two years or so. Test takers may use the Jijing do the real questions before they take the tests. Thus,
                            the Jijing is like the cheat sheet for many Chinese students and this tricky technique has been widely used by Chinese test takers.
                        </p>
                        <p>Jijing is illegal considering that ETS has let test takers to copy and sign the confidentiality agreement “to maintain the full confidentiality of all test questions, specifically not to reproduce or disclose any test question
                            in whole or in part to any person or entity in any form”. It is also unethical since it will be unfair to other test takers who have no access to the real test questions before.
                        </p>
                        <p>"My teacher of the VIP courses introduced me the Jijing and he helped me buy one," said Yue Ma, appearing at the beginning of the story, who got 14 score higher in her second TOEFL test after using the Jijing.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yue said, “The time gap between the two tests I took is just one month. Though I studied very hard, I have to admit that I encountered some real test questions in Jijing which I have prepared for.”
                        </p>
                        <p>However, there is no 100 percent guarantee that the questions in the Jijing will appear in the real test.<strong> It is still a matter of probability.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>For most of the time, as those Jijing providers claim, a probability of matching one or two sections between the Jijing and the real TOEFL test will be satisfactorily high. Compiled by different organizations, the versions of Jijing for
                            the same test on the same day may vary significantly and based on the goodness of fit, the price also varies.

                        <p>The one with high matching records will charge for a higher fee while some will give those Jijing <strong>free of charge to users as a kind of promotion</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the most popular channels is Taobao, the online shopping platform owned by Alibaba. The price is quite cheap ranging from the 5 yuan, the version of which only contains questions, to the 100 yuan, the content of which includes
                            sample answers. Among the four sections, speaking and writing are the most popular ones since they are the most difficult part for Chinese test takers as the average score the two parts are much lower among the four.
                        </p>

                        <p>But in recent years, free Jijing can be easily found online for free on Xiaozhan Education, a website focusing on TOEFL test, is now one of the most popular sources of Jijing and the TPO since both are free of charge for users
                            to download on this platform. Jijing makes this website well-known to people but does not contribute profit directly to the company.
                        </p>
                        <p>The company whose main business is providing online VIP test preparation courses and correction services for writing and speaking section of language tests, received <strong>US$29 million </strong> capital in 2015 from US based
                            GGV Capital, Shunwei Capital, which is founded by Lei Jun, the founder and chief executive officer of Xiaomi, and other three global venture capitals.

                        <p>TOEFL with a more frequent test schedule is harder to predict the pattern than the SAT. The usage of SAT Jijing has been found and reported repeatedly by media. The College Board, the organizer of SAT, has canceled some tests in
                            East Asia due to the wide range of test questions leak with the most recent one in August 2016.
                        </p>
                        <p>In May 2013, the College Board cancelled the SAT and SAT Subject Tests throughout South Korea after learning that test questions had been leaked. In January 2016, the Board shut down the administration of SAT held in Macau based
                            on “evidence that some students have been exposed to test materials intended for this administration”.
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides test cancellation, those test organizers have also cancelled or postponed the test scores. In 2010, ETS cancelled the scores of all test takers in the GRE held in test centers in China. In 2014 and 2015, the College Board
                            delayed reporting of SAT scores from students in Asia and Korea multiple times as it investigated evidence of cheating.
                        </p>
                        <p>But still, the popularity of Jijing has not been stopped. The most recent move is that the test organizer updates its question bank and change the testing form. Many students post on Weibo, one of the most popular social media
                            in China, admitting that tests are getting harder and the coverage of Jijing is getting quite limited.
                        </p>
                        <p><a href="http://weibo.com/234518650?refer_flag=1001030101_" title="Weibo Account" target="blank">
                        Wulaoshi</a>, a TOEFL teacher whose Weibo account attract over <strong>284,000</strong> followers, will post on TOEFL test days asking test takers for questions right after the end of the test. His account has been verified as
                            “Gold V” which means posts from his account have been read over 10 million times during the past month.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many people will answer the question either as a comment or by writing detailed transcript of the listening material, the reading passages, the questions for speaking and writing tasks and mentioning him on Weibo. </p>
                        <p>“I just want to check out how much test material I have understand since other people will comment me if I got it wrong,” said a Weibo user with account name Princess Bibao who posted two microblogs with detailed content regarding
                            the TOEFL test she just took and mentioned Wulaoshi.

                        Thailand has been one of the most popular overseas testing locations for IELTS test takers. “I finally got 7.5 in IELTS after four times failure,” said Ella Han who flew to Thailand mainly for the test. “I found many successful cases online posted by
                        people who indeed improved their score,” added Ella.

                    </p>
                    <p>Migrant test taking has been increasing popular in recent years. Though the test questions may be the same for the same day’s test, the marking criteria will vary among regions. Ella explained, “my oral English is much better than
                        Thailand student. However, when I took test in Hong Kong, I can just rank an average level.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeing the opportunity arising from the increasing migrant test takers, some organizations also launched “test-tour” package which includes round-trip flights, hotel accommodation, local transportation, and teacher’s tutoring and accompany.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eic Education has test tours to Thailand in May and June for SAT and ACT tests. Besides tutoring before the test, the tour also includes a special a social work volunteer activity. Students enrolling in this program will also receive
                        a social service certificate. The price for one student is 13,800 yuan, about three times the charge of an ordinary tour group.
                    </p>
                    <p>The reason for taking test in other regions may not only be for higher scores, another very important factor is that the SAT does not have a test center in Mainland despite the huge demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, for TOEFL, GRE and IELTS, due to the overwhelming demand of test seats, many people could hardly find a test seat vacancy in China, particularly during the summer and fall semester or the application season. Therefore, sometimes taking test overseas
                        a forced choice.

                        However, many Chinese students who used tricky techniques to achieve high scores in those tests have been found unable to adapt to overseas academic environment due to limited language abilities. </p>

                    <p>The high cost of test preparation courses reveals the great financial input of parents nowadays on their children’s education. It also shows the potential of the whole education market. The test preparation sector pushes the development
